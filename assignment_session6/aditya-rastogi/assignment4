1.
A class is a mechanism for users to create their own type. A class is a type and its implementation.
2.
A variable of a class is called an object.
3.
Objects or instances are used to implement a class.They are variables of the (type) class.
They are used to call methods and variables of the class outside the class.
4.
class className:
                #methods and variables to be declared
5.
A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.
6.
The self keywprd in python is used to identify between different objects of the same class.
This works only if the variables declared also use the self keyword.
7.
It is the self initialization method of the class and is called implicitly on object creation.
8.
Inheritance allows the sharing of code between classes as the base class' code is shared with the super class but not vice versa.
It must be noted that in order for this to occur the __init method of the base class nust be called explicitly in the __init method of the super class.
This allows the sharing of code and objects of the super class can directly call methods of the base class.
