Q1. Pros - 1. Python is easy to read and easy to learn
	2. It is an Object Oriented Programming language. At the same time it supports Procedural and Functional programming paradigams.
	3. It provides a large collection of standard libraries
Cons - 1. It is slow as it is an interpreted language.
	2. It is not suitable for memory intensive tasks as it has a high memory usage due to its flexibilty.

Q2. The parentheses () operator has the highest precendence.	

Q3. //-Floor divison operator. It performs divison on the two operands and returns the greatest integer smaller than the
	answer of the divison. If any one of the operands is of float type then the returned number is also of float type with 
	zero as the fractional part. 
	Eg : 11//6 = 1
	     34.0//5 = 6.0
	     -9.0//2 = -5.0

Q4. Program to delete alternate elements in a given list

#!/usr/bin/python3

list=[]
n=int(input('No. of elements : '))

#Taking user input
print('Input :')
for i in range(0,n) :
	list.append(input())
print('Input list :\n',list)

del list[1::2] #delete elements using extended slicing. Slice starting from index 1 to the end of the list in steps of 2

#printing the new list
print('Edited list :\n',list) 

Q5. Program to sort a given a list

#!/usr/bin/python3

n,temp,list=int(input('Enter no. of elements : ')),0,[]

#taking user input
print('Input %d integers :'%n)
for i in range(0,n) :
	list.append(int(input()))
print('Input : ',list)

#sorting the list using Insertion Sort
for i in range(1,n) :
	j=i-1
	while (list[j+1] < list[j] and j>=0) :
		temp=list[j]
		list[j]=list[j+1]
		list[j+1]=temp
		j-=1

#printing sorted list
print('Sorted list : ',list)

Q6. Program to print the given star pattern.
 
#!/usr/bin/python3

n=int(input('Input n : ')) #taking user input

#printing the pattern
for i in range(1,n+1) :
	print(' '*(n-i),end=("*"*(2*i-1)+"\n"))
for i in range (n-1,0,-1) :
	print(' '*(n-i),end=('*'*(2*i-1)+'\n'))
