question 1
    Pros:
        Python is very close to english language, thus fairly easy to read and write
        Time is not wasted in compilation. Can be run on the go.
        Same code can be run on all platforms with any need of optimisation.
        Very popular. Yhis means the community is large and help is available readily. Also, libraries are available for almost all kinds of workloads.
        Doesn't need declaration of variables.
        Very concise code.

    Cons:
        Interpreter based language. This means that python is very slow compared to c++ or c language.

question 2
    ** exponentiation operator has the highest priority in an expression in python.
    
question 3
    // is the integer division operator. Integer division in python rather than truncating the decimal digits, takes the floor of the obtained number.
    Eg. in C++, -2/3=0 ,alse 2/3=0 (integer division)
        in python -2//3=-1 and 2//3=0
