1. Pros:It is high-level, interpreted programming language which provides emphasis  to code-readability. Code development takes less time as compared to   C++ orJava.
  Cons:Python code takes more time to execute as compared to C++ or Java.
2. The exponential operator (**) has the highest precedence in an expression.
3. The // operator represents floor division. It performs normal division and 
   then floors the answer and gives the output as an integer.
4. Suppose given list is mylist
 for i in range(0,len(mylist)):
 if(i%2):
 print(mylist[i])
5. Suppose given list is mylist
 for i in range(0,len(mylist)):
 for j in range(1,len(mylist)-i):
 for j in range(1,len(mylist)-i):
 if(list[j-1]>list[j])
 temp=list[j-1]
 list[j-1]=list[j]
 list[j]=temp
6. code is as follows:- 
n=input("Enter the value of n\n")
n=int(n)
	for i in range(0,n):
	for j in range(0,n):
	if(i+j>=n-1):
print("*",end="")
	else:
print(" ",end="")
	for j in range(0,i):
print("*",end="")
print("")
	for i in range(0,n-1):
	for j in range(0,n):
	if(j>i):
print("*",end="")
	else:
print(" ",end="")
	for j in range(0,n-2-i):
print("*",end="")
print("")
