1. Pros:
a)Python is a high level language
b)It has great readability.
c) It is extremely effective as "glue' code, to join parts coded in different languages.
d)It is very easy to learn and code can be developed much faster.

Cons:
a) It is very slow to execute.


2. Exponentiation operator (**)


3. // is called the floor division operator. It basically rounds off the answer we get after dividing to greatest integer lesser than or equal to the answer.
So 10//4=2, not 2.5


4.
print("Enter the list members")
l = input(">>>").split()
ans = []
for i in l:
   if (i not in ans):
        ans.append(i)
print("The list without alternate entries is:", end="")
print(ans)


5.
print("Enter the list members")
l = input(">>>").split()
for i in range(len(l)-1):
    for j in range(len(l)-1-i):
        if l[j] > l[j+1]:
            l[j], l[j+1] = l[j+1], l[j]
print("The sorted list is:", end="")
print(l)


6.
print("Enter n")
n = int(input(">>>"))
for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range(n-i):
        print(end=" ")
    for j in range(2*i-1):
        print("*",end="")
    print()
for i in range(1,n):
    for j in range(i):
        print(end=" ")
    for j in range(2*(n-i)-1):
        print("*",end="")
    print()
