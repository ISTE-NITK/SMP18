1.
Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the
end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not
exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.

2.
Every file when read, transfers data to an intermediate buffer before it
can be accessed by Python, this makes the process faster and reduces the risk of data loss while handling data.

	file1=open(input("Enter name of the file\n"),'r+')
	file1.seek(0,2)	
	file1.write(t)
	except IOError:
		print("ERROR Enter valid filename")
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print("ERROR can't divide by zero")
	else:
		print("everything's fine")
		file1.close()
