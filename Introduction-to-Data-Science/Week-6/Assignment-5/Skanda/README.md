These are the accuracies I got with different models:
1. Logistic Regressor: 95.804 %
2. KNN: 95.104 %
3. SVM (linear): 97.202 %
4. SVM (rbf): 96.503 %
5. Naive Bayes: 91.608 %
6. Decision Tree: 95.804 %
7. Random Forest: 95.804 %


Model Used: SVM (linear) with 97.202 % accuracy


Code flow:
1. Importing files
2. Getting the dataset
3. Making of features and target
4. Splitting of dataset into test and training sets
5. Feature scaling (Important for SVM linear)
6. Making of SVM classifier with linear kernel
7. Predicting test set
8. Making of confusion matrix
