1.  ab+ mode is used to open(or create and open) a binary file in append+ mode.

2.  The data is to be read is first loaded into the buffer from the raw data file as accessing the raw file can lead to high latency in some cases depending on the storage device. Hence the reqd data is first loaded into buffer and then easily accessed. 
3.
try:
    fp = fopen("iste.txt",'r')
    a=1/0
    print("successful")
    fp.close()
except IOError:
    print("not able to read from the file")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('cannot divide by zero')
finally:
    print("you have reached the end")

4.
f=open("file.txt",'r+')
i=0
dict={}
last=f.seek(0,2)
f.seek(0,0)
while f.tell()!=last:
    s=f.readline()
    dict[i]=s
    i-=1
sort=sorted(dict)
for i in range (0,len(sort)):
    print(dict[sort[i]])
