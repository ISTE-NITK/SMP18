Question1:
Solution:
A class is a code template for creating objects.
Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them.

Question2:
Solution:
A variable of class type which has all its attributes is called an object.

Question3:
Solution:
A class defines the properties and behavior for the objects represented by the abstraction.
 Abstraction is a property of object oriented programming. It denotes the essential properties 
 and behaviors of an object. It hides code and data. A class thus denotes a category of objects 
 and act as a blueprint for creating such objects. 
 An object exhibits the property and behaviors defined by its class.

 Question4:
 Solution:
 Syntax:
 class NEWCLASS:
	def printhello(self):
		print(hello)
		
Question 5:
Solution:
A method is a function that takes a class instance as its first parameter. 
Methods are members of classes.
eg. printhello(self) is a method.

Question6:
Solution:
Self refers to the object whose method was called.

Question7:
Solution:
__init__ is a constructor.It is autoatically called when an object
of the class is created.

Question8:
Solution:
When a class inherits from another class , it's object can access methods from
the inherited class also.
Thus we need not write methods again for the inheriting class.


Question 9:
Solution:
import random
import numpy as np
class deck_of_card:
    
    class card:
        def __init__(self,suit,num):
            self.suit=suit

            self.cards.append(self.card('ace',i))

        for i in range(13):
             self.cards.append(self.card('heart',i))
        for i in range(13):

        for i in range(13):
             self.cards.append(self.card('club',i))
        print(len(self.cards))
        print(self.cards[51].suit)
    def deal(self,suit,num):
        i=0
        for i in range(51):
            
            if self.cards[i].suit==suit and self.cards[i].num == num:
                del self.cards[i]
    def shuffle(self):
        if (len(self.cards))==52:
            random.shuffle(self.cards)
            for i in range(52):
                print(self.cards[i].suit, self.cards[i].num)
        else:
            print('All cards are not there',len(self.cards))

Question 10:
Solution:
		class person:
    def __init__(self,first='',last='',phno='',el=[]):               
        self.first_name=first
        self.last_name=last
        self.phone_num=phno
        self.email=el
    def cont(self):
        print(self.first_name)
        print(self.last_name)
        print(self.phone_num)
        print(self.email)
    
class address_book:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adbook=[]
    def add_contact(self,f,l,ph,em):
        self.adbook.append(person(f,l,ph,em))
    def look_up_contact(self,l,f=''):
        for i in range(len(self.adbook)):
            if self.adbook[i].last_name==l:
                print(self.adbook[i].cont());
        
a=address_book()
a.add_contact('madhu','parna',6888,'ms@gmail.com')
a.look_up_contact('parna')
