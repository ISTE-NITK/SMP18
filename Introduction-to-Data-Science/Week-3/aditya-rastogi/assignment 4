	b=int(input("Enter divisor\n"))
	file1=open(input("Enter file name to store quotient\n"),'r+')
	file1.seek(0,2)	
	file1.write(str(a/b))
	file1.close()
except IOError:
	print("ERROR Enter valid filename")
except ValueError:
	print("ERROR enter integer")
except ZeroDivisionError:
	print("ERROR can't divide by zero")
