q1:
    Class implements the OOP concept in python. It provides a way to encapsulate all data and methods related to an object into one package.

q2:
    An instance in python is a class object that has all the attributes described in the class definition.

q3:
    A class defines how the object should work and all its attributes.
    An instance is the implementation of the class definition in a code.

q4:
    class newClass(inheritClass):
        attributes

q5:
    any function that is defined inside the class of the object is called a method of the object.

q6:
    self is a way in python class to refer to the attributes of the object.
    This helps segregate method parametres from the object member functions.

q7:
    __init__ is a method which is equivalent to a constructor in c++.
    __init__ is called whenever a new object of the class is formed and it initializes the object.

q8:
    the derived class inherits from a base class. In this process the the attributes of the base class are available to the object of the derived class.
    This prevents code duplication and encourages code reuse.
