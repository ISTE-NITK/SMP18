1. A class is single entity or type in which all the related data and methods are contained.


2. An object is a variable of the type class.


3. An instance is a variable of the class type. It can access the data and the methods which the class contains.


4. syntax:

class ClassName (InheritedClass):  #InheritedClass opional
    #methods
    #attributes 


5. Methods are functions defined inside a class which can only be used by an object of that class or object of any class that has inherited the original class.


6. Self is an argument passed to the methods which help in differentiating various objects of the same class.


7. The __init__() method is a constructor which is implicitly called whenever an object is created. Its primary function is to allocate memory for the object.


8. Suppose class A and B need same data and methods except that B requires additional attributes. Instead of maintaining the two different copies of the same functions and data in A and B, B can be inherited from A. This prevents duplicaton of code in B.
