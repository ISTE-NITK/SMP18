1. class is a type and implementation.

2. A variable of the class type is called an object.

3. Instances are the objects that has all the attributes(members and methods) described in the class definition.

4.class class_name:
	def method_name(self,arguments):
		pass

5.A method is a function that takes a class instance as its first parameter. Methods are members of classes. 

6. self refers to a newly created object in init method and in other class methods,refers to the instance whose method was called.

7. init method is called when an object is created from the class and it allow the class to initialize the attributes of a class.

8.inheritance helps one to access the methods in one class from another without having to repeat the same code in the second class.
